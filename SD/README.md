# 🏗️ System Design

**System Design** is the process of defining the **architecture**, **components**, **data flow**, and **interfaces** of a software system with the goal of meeting specific functional and non-functional requirements such as:

1. Scalability  
2. Reliability  
3. Availability  
4. Maintainability  
5. Performance  

> *System Design is about designing how a complete software system works from the inside out — not just writing code, but thinking deeply about how parts interact, how data flows, how users engage with the system, and how it behaves at scale.*

## 🧠 When to Use System Design

System design becomes essential when:

1. You're building something larger than a simple script or basic app — especially if it's user-facing or meant to scale.
2. You need to ensure the system can handle:
   - **Scalability** (millions of users or operations)
   - **Reliability** (survive failures or downtime)
   - **Performance** (fast responses under load)
   - **Security** (safe access and data protection)
3. You're designing:
   - Backend infrastructure  
   - Distributed systems  
   - Microservices architecture  
   - Cloud-based applications  
   - Data-intensive pipelines

## 🧱 Types of System Design

### 1. 🌐 HLD – High Level Design

**HLD** is the architectural blueprint of the entire system. It answers the **"what"** and **"how"** at a broader, system-wide level.

#### 🎯 Purpose:
- Defines how components interact  
- Focuses on scalability, availability, security, and tech stack choices  
- Identifies major modules, APIs, databases, servers, etc.  

#### 📌 HLD Includes:
- System architecture diagrams (e.g. `Client ↔ Load Balancer ↔ Backend ↔ DB`)  
- Microservices/modules and their responsibilities  
- Communication patterns (REST APIs, Message Queues, etc.)  
- Tech stack selection  
- Database choices and high-level schema  
- Scalability & fault-tolerance strategies (e.g. CDN, Replication)

> 🏙️ *Think of HLD like city planning — roads, districts, power grids, and water lines.*

### 2. 🧩 LLD – Low Level Design

**LLD** is the detailed internal design of each component defined in HLD. It answers the **"how exactly"** questions — like creating blueprints for individual buildings in your city.

#### 🎯 Purpose:
- Describes internal logic, classes, data models, algorithms, and workflows  
- Helps developers understand exactly what needs to be built  

#### 📌 LLD Includes:
- Class diagrams  
- Object relationships  
- API contract details (endpoints, parameters, response models)  
- Database table structures  
- Function definitions or pseudocode  
- Internal business logic breakdown
